## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

### ⚠️ Missing Stripe Variables
Add these to `.env.local` and Vercel:

```bash

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...  # Server-side secret key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...  # Client-side publishable key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # Webhook signing secret

# Optional but Recommended
STRIPE_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT=20  # Default platform fee percentage
```

### ✅ Currently Set Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` ✓
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ✓
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` ✓
- `RESEND_API_KEY` ✓

## 🚀 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Before Stripe Integration:
- [ ] Get Stripe API keys (test mode)
- [ ] Set up Stripe account
- [ ] Configure Stripe Connect (if using marketplace)
- [ ] Set up webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Add environment variables to Vercel
- [ ] Test in Stripe test mode

### Critical Path:
1. ✅ Database schema ready
2. ⚠️ Stripe API routes needed
3. ⚠️ Payment UI integration needed
4. ⚠️ Webhook handler needed
5. ⚠️ Stripe Connect flow needed

## 📝 Recommendations

1. **Start with Test Mode**
   - Implement all features in Stripe test mode first
   - Use test cards: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Verify webhook handling works

2. **Implement in Phases**
   - Phase 1: Basic course payments (simplest)
   - Phase 2: Appointment payments
   - Phase 3: Stripe Connect for marketplace
   - Phase 4: Payouts and fees

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Never expose `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to client
   - Validate webhook signatures
   - Use idempotency keys for payments
   - Implement proper error handling

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test successful payments
   - Test failed payments
   - Test refunds
   - Test webhook retries
   - Test Stripe Connect flow

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Set up Stripe account and get API keys
2. **Priority 1:** Implement checkout session API route
3. **Priority 2:** Implement webhook handler
4. **Priority 3:** Update UI to use Stripe checkout
5. **Priority 4:** Implement Stripe Connect flow
6. **Priority 5:** Build payout dashboard

---

**Summary:** The application is structurally ready for Stripe integration. Database schema is complete, dependencies are installed, and the build is successful. However, the actual Stripe payment processing code needs to be implemented before launching the marketplace feature.
